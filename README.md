## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer and the creator of the open source projects below ðŸ‘‡

I currently work at [Booking.com](https://booking.com), previously [Spotify](https://spotify.com), [Backbase](https://backbase.com), and others.

I love building iOS frameworks and apps, web APIs and contributing to open source projects. Swift is my favored tool, but I also enjoy working with other languages like Python, Ruby, and Javascript.

On the side, I enjoy practicing Arabic calligraphy, playing the piano, and looking for the best cup of espresso in town.

You can find me online on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/omaralbeik) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omaralbeik).
