### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software Engineer at [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) and the creator of the open source projects below ðŸ‘‡

I love building iOS frameworks, web APIs and contributing to open source projects. Swift is my favored tool, but I also enjoy working with other languages like Python, Ruby, and Javascript.

You can use [this page](https://omaralbeik.com/calendar) to book a 15 min call to say hi, or find me online on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/omaralbeik) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omaralbeik).

I enjoy sharing knowledge with fellow software enthusiasts and would be happy to meet over a cup of coffee, take part in conferences, or be a guest on podcasts.
