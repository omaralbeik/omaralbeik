### Hi there 👋

I'm a Software Engineer at [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com) and the creator of the open source projects below 👇

I love building iOS frameworks and apps, web APIs and contributing to open source projects. Swift is my favored tool, but I also enjoy working with other languages like Python, Ruby, and Javascript.

You can find me online on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/omaralbeik) and [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omaralbeik).

I enjoy sharing knowledge with fellow software enthusiasts and would be happy to meet over a cup of coffee, take part in conferences, or be a guest on podcasts.
