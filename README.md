## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Omar, a software engineer and the creator of [Tilfaz](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1668359578) and [Fontastic](https://apps.apple.com/app/id1537294729), two apps designed to bring unique experiences to users!

I love building apps, frameworks, and web APIs, contributing to open source projects, and exploring new technologies. Swift is my favored tool, though I also enjoy working with Python, Ruby, and JavaScript.

Currently, I work at [Booking.com](https://booking.com), previously [Spotify](https://spotify.com), [Backbase](https://backbase.com), and others.

On the side, I enjoy practicing [Arabic calligraphy](https://www.omaralbeik.com/gallery), playing the piano, and hunting for the best espresso in town.

Find me online on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/omaralbeik).
