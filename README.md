## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Omar

I love building apps, frameworks, and tools, contributing to open source projects, and exploring new technologies. Swift is my favored language, though I also enjoy working with Python, TypeScript, and Ruby.

Currently, I lead engineering at [Harf Labs](https://harflabs.com), previously wored at [Booking.com](https://booking.com), [Spotify](https://spotify.com), [Backbase](https://backbase.com), and others.

On the side, I love practicing [Arabic calligraphy](https://www.omaralbeik.com/gallery), playing the piano, and hunting for the best espresso in town.
